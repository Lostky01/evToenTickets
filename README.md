# 🎟️ E-Ticket System

> **A Laravel-based ticketing system for school events**

---

## 🚀 Newest Features

🔥 **Event Date Logic**: If the event has passed, tickets can't be checked out or scanned. Don't even try, bruh.

🔥 **Ticket Status Update**: "Ongoing" tickets automatically change to "Completed" after the event ends. No more manual work, you're welcome.

🔥 **Transaction History Menu**: You can now see past transactions. Just in case you forgot where your money went.

🔥 **Scanner Logic Improvements**: Now the scanner actually understands time. It knows if the event is ongoing, finished, or hasn't started yet. Smarter than some people, tbh.

## ❓ Q&A

### 🤨 Why did you make this website?
<i style="color: cyan;">Please mind reading the about first.</i>

### 🤨 Why are you still using PHP?
<i style="color: red;"> PHP gets the job done. Plus, I'm transitioning to electrical engineering soon. Web development? Nuh uh, not my problem anymore.</i>

### 🤨 Why are you using a template?
<i style="color: green;">Hell no, I'm not wasting my time crafting CSS from scratch. You want a pretty site or a hot mess? Time's ticking, and I'm not getting paid for this. Deal with it.</i>

### 🤨 Why not use React, Vue, or whatever JavaScript framework?
<i style="color: blue;">Bro, I cherish my sanity. Laravel does it all—backend and frontend in one neat package. No npm install run dev bullcrap. Simple life, happy life.</i>

### 🤨 Why are you using QR codes from simplesoftware.io?
<i style="color: purple;">Duh, because it freaking works. I'm not here to reinvent the wheel. Efficiency is key, my dude.</i>

### 🤨 Why not make this a SaaS product and make money?
<i style="color: orange;">Hell nah I'm too lazy to handle customer complaints. Plus, I love my sleep more than money. Priorities, bruh.</i>

### 🤨 Why is the code full of comments?
<i style="color: teal;">What the hell do you mean? Comments are there so you don't mess things up when you touch my code. Read them, or don't. Your funeral.</i>

### 🤨 Why didn't you write tests for this project?
<i style="color: brown;">Tests? Ain't nobody got time for that. If it works, it works. If it breaks, well, that's a problem for future me. Or you. Whatever.</i>

### 🤨 Why is the documentation lacking?
<i style="color: magenta;">Documentation? Pfft. The code is the documentation. Dive in and figure it out. It's not rocket science, duh.</i>

### 🤨 Why didn't you use Docker for this project?
<i style="color: navy;">Docker? Hell no. My machine works just fine. If it runs on my setup, it should run on yours. Not my fault if it doesn't.</i>

### 🤨 Why is the UI so basic?
<i style="color: olive;">Because function over form, my friend. It works, doesn't it? If you want it prettier, be my guest and spruce it up yourself.</i>

### 🤨 Why is the database structure so simple?
<i style="color: gold;">Because it doesn't need to be complicated. Do you want a ticket system or a full-blown enterprise solution? Keep it simple, stupid.</i>

### 🤨 Why didn't you use Tailwind CSS?
<i style="color: cyan;">Bruh, I ain't got time to learn another CSS framework. Bootstrap does what I need, Plus the deadline is in the end of the month i guess. End of discussion.</i>
