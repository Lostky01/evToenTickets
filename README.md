# 🎟️ E-Ticket System

> **A Laravel-based ticketing system for school events**

---

## 🚀 Newest Features

🔥 **Event Date Logic**: If the event has passed, tickets can't be checked out or scanned. Don't even try, bruh.

🔥 **Ticket Status Update**: "Ongoing" tickets automatically change to "Completed" after the event ends. No more manual work, you're welcome.

🔥 **Transaction History Menu**: You can now see past transactions. Just in case you forgot where your money went.

🔥 **Scanner Logic Improvements**: Now the scanner actually understands time. It knows if the event is ongoing, finished, or hasn't started yet. Smarter than some people, tbh.

## ❓ Q&A

### 🤨 Why are you still using PHP?
<i style="color: red;">I don't care, bruh. I'm about to leave website development anyway to advance to electrical engineering and more advanced coding.</i>

### 🤨 Why are you using a template?
<i style="color: green;">Bro, I'm not about to waste my life writing CSS from scratch. Do you want the site to look good or not? Plus, time is money, and I'm already broke. Deal with it.</i>

### 🤨 Why not use React, Vue, or whatever JavaScript framework?
<i style="color: blue;">Because I like my sanity intact. Laravel is enough. Backend + Frontend in one place, no npm run dev nonsense. Simple life.</i>

### 🤨 Why are you using QR codes from simplesoftware.io?
<i style="color: purple;">Because it works, and I don't wanna reinvent the wheel. Ain't nobody got time for that.</i>

### 🤨 Why not make this a SaaS product and make money?
<i style="color: orange;">Because I'm too lazy to deal with customer support. Also, I value my sleep.</i>
